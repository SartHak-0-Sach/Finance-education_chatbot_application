## Overview
The **Finance Education Chatbot Application** is a conversational AI-based chatbot designed to assist users with basic finance-related questions and provide educational content on topics such as budgeting, investing, saving, and financial planning. The chatbot is built using natural language processing (NLP) and integrates with financial resources to deliver accurate and helpful responses to users.

### The challenge
The goal of this project was to develop a chatbot that:
- **Interacts with users** in a conversational manner to provide educational content on personal finance topics.
- **Handles a wide range of finance-related questions**, such as those about investing, savings, credit scores, and budgeting.
- **Integrates with external APIs** to fetch financial data (e.g., currency exchange rates or stock market trends).
- **Improves over time** by learning from user interactions and feedback.

### Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Built with NLP models to understand user queries and respond intelligently.
- **Financial Education:** Provides information on various finance topics, including savings, budgeting, credit, and investing.
- **Interactive Chat Interface:** A simple, user-friendly chat interface for seamless interaction.
- **External API Integration:** Fetch real-time financial data like currency exchange rates and stock prices.
- **User Feedback:** Allows users to rate the chatbotâ€™s responses to improve future interactions.
- **Multi-language Support:** Can be extended to support multiple languages for a wider audience.

```

### Technologies Used
- **Python** for backend logic and chatbot implementation
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using libraries like **NLTK** or **spaCy** for understanding user input
- **Flask/Django** for building the web application and serving the chatbot interface
- **External APIs** (e.g., Alpha Vantage for stock market data, Open Exchange Rates for currency conversion)
- **JavaScript** and **HTML/CSS** for building the frontend chat interface
- **SQLite/MySQL** for storing conversation logs and user feedback
- **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** for training custom NLP models (if required)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Node.js (for frontend development)
- Basic knowledge of NLP and chatbot development
- Access to financial data APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage for stock market data)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/finance-education_chatbot_application.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd finance-education_chatbot_application
   ```
3. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Install the required frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd app
   npm install
   ```
5. Set up environment variables for external API keys (e.g., for Alpha Vantage or Open Exchange Rates):
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your keys:
   ```
   ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   OPEN_EXCHANGE_RATES_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```
6. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
7. Run the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

### Usage
1. **Chatbot Interaction:** Users can type questions related to personal finance, and the chatbot will respond with relevant educational content and resources.
2. **API Data:** The chatbot can provide real-time financial information like currency rates or stock prices by fetching data from external APIs.
3. **User Feedback:** After each interaction, users can provide feedback on the chatbotâ€™s response to improve its performance.

### Future Improvements
- Integrate machine learning to make the chatbot more intelligent and context-aware.
- Extend multi-language support to make the chatbot accessible to a global audience.
- Implement **voice interaction** for a more natural conversational experience.
- Add **financial tools** like budget planners, savings calculators, and investment risk assessments.
